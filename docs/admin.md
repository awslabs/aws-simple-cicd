# Administrator Guide

These instructions are for the users who will be deploying and maintaining the platform.

0. [Setup Project Config](#setup-project-config)
1. [Configure Accounts](#configure-accounts)
2. [Configure Naming](#configure-naming)
3. [Configure Pipelines](#configure-pipelines)
4. [Grouping Pipelines](#grouping-pipelines)
5. [Deploying Pipelines](#deploy-pipelines)

## Setup Project Config

Create a [project-config.json](../project-config.sample.json) file in the root of the Simple-CICD project. There is a sample ***project-config.sample.json*** file provided

## Configure Accounts

Add the account ids of the target accounts to the project-config.json file. The account Id will be passed to the deployment stage as an environment variable. Leave the account id blank for any environment you do not want to target.

```text
{
  dev: string,
  test: string,
  prod: string
}
```

Example:

```json
{
  "dev": "123456789000",
  "test": "123456789001",
  "prod": "123456789002"
}
```

### Deploy cross-account IAM role *(if needed)*

If you already have a cross-account role set up for deployments, then skip step 1.

#### Step 1

The pipelines will be deployed and executed in the Shared Services account. The pipeline will need to assume an IAM role in the target  accounts in order to provision resources.

A sample IAM role and profile is provided in this project if this does not already exist. Modify [deployment-role.yaml](../cross-account/deployment-role.yaml) based on your requirements and deploy it using the following commands. This role will need to be deployed to each target (dev, test and prod) AWS account.

```bash
cd cross-account

aws cloudformation deploy --template-file deployment-role.yaml --stack-name cicd-iam-stack --capabilities CAPABILITY_NAMED_IAM --parameter-overrides SharedAccountId={SHARED-ACCOUNT-ID}
```
Note: Replace {SHARED-ACCOUNT-ID} with the appropiate ID.

The IAM role name in the sample provided is ***deployment-role***.

#### Step 2

Set the cross-account role name in the [sample](../project-config.sample.json) file. Update ***cicdRoleName***.

```bash
"deployment": {
    "region": "ca-central-1",
    "cicdRoleName": "deployment-role"
  },
```

## Configure Naming

All the AWS resources provisioned by this project will follow a standard naming convention. This can be configured as desired.

```text
{
  company: string,
  dept: string,
  project: string
}
```

Example:

This will generate resources prefixed with ***acme-markets-roadrunner***

```json
{
  "company": "acme",
  "dept": "markets",
  "project":  "roadrunner"
}
```

## Configure Pipelines

- The pipeline name and branch are concatenated to create a unique pipeline per branch.
- The sample provides a single TriggerType - CodeCommit. This can be extended to add Github, BitBucket etc.
- An SNS Topic is generated for the pipeline. Subscribers receive notifications on status of each pipeline stage. Emails are sent by a Lambda function.
- A Parameter Store parameter is generated which stores the semantic version and automatically increments (uses python semver library) on every successful build.
- A Cron parameter can be set to trigger the pipeline on a schedule managed by CloudWatch.

```text
{
  pipelineName: string,
  ccRepoName: string,
  branch: string,
  type: TriggerType,
  cron: string
}
```

Example:

The following sample will generate a pipeline called ***acme-markets-roadrunner-rocket-powered-skates-master***

```json
{
  "pipelineName": "rocket-powered-skates",
  "ccRepoName": "rocket-powered-skates",
  "branch": "master",
  "type": "CodeCommit",
  "cron": ""
}
```

## Grouping Pipelines

AWS CloudFormation has a limit of 500 resources per stack. To bypass this limitation we recommend grouping pipelines together and generating a separate stack for each group. In the [sample](../project-config.sample.json) the pipelines are grouped by team, Team One and Team Two.

### Adding a new group

1. Create a new array in project-config.json for Team Three. See teamOne or teamTwo for an example.

    ```bash
    "teamThree": [
      {
        "pipelineName": "rocket-powered-skates",
        "ccRepoName": "rocket-powered-skates",
        "branch": "master",
        "type": "CodeCommit",
        "cron": ""
      }
    ]
    ```

1. Update [config.ts](../config/config.ts) and update the ProjectConfig interface by exporting the configuration for Team Three.

    ```bash
      teamThree:  Array<ProjectRepo>
    ```

1. Update [cicd.ts](../bin/cicd.ts) to generate a new stack for Team Three.

    ```bash
      new CicdStack(app, 'AWS-Simple-CICD-TeamThree', { prefix, ssmRoot, repos: config.teamThree})
    ```  

Group your pipelines based on your needs. Grouping by teams is just provided as an example.

## Deploying Pipelines

If you have not installed AWS CDK already please refer to the [pre-requisites](./prereq.md)

```bash
npm install

npm run build

# The bootstrap only needs to be executed once
cdk bootstrap --profile <shared services account profile>

cdk deploy --all --profile <shared services account profile>
```
